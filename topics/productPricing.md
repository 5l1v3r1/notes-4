There are two ways to get to the price:
1. Cost based
2. Value based - strive for this one

# 4 common mistakes

1. Prices are too low

2. Underestimate costs

3. Don't understand your value
    - Either they don't understand your value, or you're unable to convince them.

4. Focus on wrong customers
    - *"If I build a better product, and half charge half the competition, I win..."* You are looking for people that won't base their decision on price alone.

# Product lifecycle

Startups live in the 1st and 2nd stage, and the customers there are not mainstream, they're early adopters.

*"Studies indicated that demand does not begin to accelerate untils the first 2%-5% of potential buyers adopt the product"*

What would the business look like if you're a billion dollar company i.e. $100M in sales **annually**, or $8M **monthly**.

SMB = The *danger zone*, where a lot of companies are in and they struggle, where the customer treats their money like consumers but they kinda look like an enterprise.

| Annual | Monthly |
|---|---|
| $100 | $8 |
| $1K | $83 |
| $10K | $833 |
| $100K | $8,333 |
