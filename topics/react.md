React is a library that only takes care of rendering the view while making sure it's in sync with the state.

# React Create App

Zero-configuration setup, creates all the boilerplate for you.

```bash
sudo npm i -g create-react-app
create-react-app app-name
```

It will install:

-   Lightweight development server
-   Webpack (bundler)
-   Babel (transpiler)

It also enables hot module reloading, which means we don't have to re-build and refresh after each change.

**Available commands:**
```bash
npm start        # Starts the development server.
npm run build    # Bundles the app into static files for production.
npm test         # Starts the test runner.
npm run eject    # Removes all the configuration abstractions.
```

### Errors

You appear to be offline. Falling back to the local Yarn cache.

```bash
sudo apt-get remove yarn && sudo apt-get purge yarn

npm config set registry "https://registry.npmjs.org"
```

### Eject

This will permanently remove this tool and add all the abstracted dependencies in `package.json` and the config files will appear. This allows detailed configurations.

```bash
npm run eject
```

# Hello World

```javascript
// React object from module.
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";

const element = <h1>Hello World</h1>; // JSX expression

ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById("app"));
```

# JSX

It's syntactic sugar for creating HTML elements with javascript, instead of using templating engines. It's not a string, but an expression.

```jsx
const element = <h1>Hello World</h1>;
```

Babel transpiles it into...

```javascript
var element = React.createElement("h1", null, "Hello World");
```

Since the compiled JSX makes a call to `React.createElement`, we need to import `React`, even if we don't use the object directly.

This returns an `Object`, a React element, which is part of the virtual-DOM.

The call to the function is the reason why we need one parent element, as Babel gets confused with multiple.

# Virtual-DOM

Lightweight in-memory representation of the UI. Instead of re-building the DOM on each change, the virtual DOM sees the changes and it just updates the changed parts in the real DOM.

Whenever the state of the React element object changes...

-   React gets a new React element.
-   Compares it to the previous one to see the changes.
-   Update just the changed parts in the real DOM.

The DOM updating is done by the `render()` method in the `react-dom` module. It takes the object returned from JSX and renders the HTML inside the referenced div.

# Components

A piece of UI. A javascript class that has some state to be displayed and a render method.

**counter.jsx**

```javascript
import React, { Component } from "react";

class Counter extends Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <div>Counter</div>
                <button>Increment</button>
            </div>
        );
    }
}

export default Counter;
```

**index.js**

```javascript
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import Counter from "./components/counter";

ReactDOM.render(<Counter />, document.getElementById("root"));
```

# State

**The component owning the state should be the one modifying it.**

**The state should reside in the parent component, to be passed to the child.** 

**If two components need to share the same state, then the state needs to be lifted one level up to their parent component.**

`setState` is used for updating the state AND re-rendering the view i.e. syncing the DOM with the virtual DOM.

The method takes an object, and merges or overwrites the state object with it.

If we update the state directly, React is unaware of the change, and nothing is rendered.

### Props vs State

`Props` includes data that we give to a component. `State` is data that is local/private to a component.

# Events

The event naming convention is to prefix the function with `handle`.

```javascript
class Foo extends Component {
    handleSomething() {
        console.log("Something handled");
    }

    render() {
        return <button onClick={this.handleSomething}>Do something</button>;
    }
}
```

## Binding this

`onClick={this.handleSomething}` results in `undefined`, because `this` references the global object and React runs in `strict mode`.

### Arrow function

```javascript
class Foo extends Component {
    state = {
        bar: "bar"
    };

    handleSomething = () => {
        console.log(this.state.bar);
    };

    render() {
        return <button onClick={this.handleSomething}>Do something</button>;
    }
}
```

### bind()

Since we cannot use `onClick={this.handleSomething("value")}`, we need to use an arrow function.

```javascript
class Foo extends Component {
    state = {
        bar: "bar"
    };

    handleSomething() {
        console.log(this.state.bar);
    }

    render() {
        return (
            <button onClick={this.handleSomething.bind(this)}>
                Do something
            </button>
        );
    }
}
```

## Event arguments

```javascript
class Foo extends Component {
    state = {
        bar: "bar"
    };

    handleSomething = argument => {
        console.log(argument);
    };

    render() {
        return (
            <button onClick={() => this.handleSomething("baz")}>
                Do something
            </button>
        );
    }
}
```

# CSS

```javascript
class Foo extends Component {
    styles = {
        fontSize: 10,
        fontWeight: "bold"
    };

    render() {
        return <div style={this.style}>Some text</div>;
    }
}
```

```javascript
class Foo extends Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <div style={{ fontSize: 30, fontWeight: "bold" }}>Some text</div>
        );
    }
}
```
